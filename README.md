# Heart-Failure-Prediction
Predict Heart Failure Using IBM Auto AI Service


Project Workflow -

1. Created an IBM cloud account.
2. Created Watson Studio Service.
3. Created Node Red Service.
4. Data set collection - Collected the required data set from Kaggle website. This data set               
                                     consists of heart failure medical records.
5. Reviewed the data set for the column categories and prediction column.
6. Created the Watson Studio Project.
7. Added an Auto AI experiment.
8. Ran the auto AI experiment on the data set collected.
9. Generated a suitable machine learning model for the prediction. Model generated - P4          
     Random Forest Classifier.
10. Saved and deployed the model.
11. Built a node red application with a suitable UI for the required predictions.
12. Integrated The Node red app with Auto AI model using http requests and api reference key.
13. Ran a few test cases - results as expected.
